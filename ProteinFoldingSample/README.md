# Protein Folding Sample

This sample is not compatible with Inference Engine, only Sentis 1.X.

Protein folding visualization demo showing how to render and visualize protein folding in real time 3D.

This demo is a simplified recreation of Alphafold (version 1) which won the CASP (2018) protein folding competition. 
It is based off this implementation: https://github.com/Urinx/alphafold_pytorch

The purpose of this demo is to demonstrate the Unity Sentis API and how it can be useful for scientific visualisation.
